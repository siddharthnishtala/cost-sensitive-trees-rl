# Cost-Sensitive Trees for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning

This repository contains the source code accompanying the paper [Cost-Sensitive Trees for Interpretable Reinforcement Learning](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3632410.3632443).

## Installation

The codebase uses slightly modified versions of scikit-learn and stable-baselines3 libraries. 
Building scikit-learn from source requires other dependencies. Please follow instructions from [here](https://scikit-learn.org/dev/developers/advanced_installation.html#building-from-source) to setup before installing these libraries.

Once this is setup, the libraries and all other dependencies can be installed using:

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

The code was written and tested on Python 3.7.9.
